It has been going on in my mind for few days, however haven't got the zeal to express. I thank god for being kind to me in the treatment he meted out so far.

2020 has been unprecedented to most people alive. Many have lost their near and dear ones, many have themselves suffered un imaginable personal or material loss. Some of them whom I respect are [Irrfan Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrfan_Khan), [Rishi Kapoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Kapoor), [Sushant Sing Rajput](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushant_Singh_Rajput), [Pranab Mukherjee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pranab_Mukherjee), [S P Balasubramaniam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._P._Balasubrahmanyam) and many more.

The loss of SPB particularly has left me with a feeling that's hard to express. I grew up listening to his songs without knowing a lot about him or realizing his achievements. It's through his reality based singing competition [Padutha Teeyaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padutha_Theeyaga) that I was introduced to the pride of [Telugu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_language). It is an ethereal experience to hear Balu's songs, his commentaries on the beautiful complexions in [Telugu Sahityam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_literature), the intricacies of music, the unknown stories behind great compositions and more importantly his values towards his friends, detractors, well wishers etc. The way he gently but firmly guides the aspiring singers is the best master class for singers.

My veering towards [Stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism) meant that I was mostly indifferent to any loss personal or otherwise. However, SPB's absence has left an indelible mark not just on my mind but on the way I conduct my life. This post is a very weak attempt at articulating what his loss means to me.

"vEdam anuvannuva nadam" is a soulful rendition by SPB from the movie [Sagara Sangamam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagara_Sangamam). The [subhashita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subhashita) at the end of this rendition aptly summarizes the great man.

जयन्ति ते सुकृतिनो  रससिद्धाः कवीश्वराः |

नास्ति येषां यशः काये जरामरणजं भयम् ||

#### English:

Jayanti te sukrutino rasasiddhaah kaveeshvaraah.

Naasti yeshaam yashh kaaye  jaramaranajam bhayam.


#### Summary:

Righteous  persons, well versed in poetry and lord among poets, who are unconcerned about their fame and upkeep of their body and are also not afraid of old age and death, are the real winners in their life.
