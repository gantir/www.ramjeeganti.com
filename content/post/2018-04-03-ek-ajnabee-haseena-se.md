Soft, soothing music aka the 60s, 70s Hindi melodies is something I love to listen on and on and on. The other day I heard [Ek Ajnabee Haseena se](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgKueB7fCzs) a timeless melody from the 1974 movie [Ajnabee] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajanabee_(1974_film)).

This post is not about that. I wanted to watch the video and searched on my phone for "Ek Ajnabee Haseena Se", I was pretty surprised to see that the first result was not the original song but a musical video remake. I was a tad disappointed to start with and was furious on knowing that it was actually an advertisement for [Doublemint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublemint). However, something stopped me from closing the video, it felt vaguely familiar. When I played it I was beeming with a smile and slipped into nostalgia.

I am not a fan of remakes, rarely have I seen a remake which can match the original, leave alone upping the game. But here is one, which not only holds a candle to the original but also slightly surpasses it, at least for its massively cheesily cute video.

Go watch it here and get the past rolling...
